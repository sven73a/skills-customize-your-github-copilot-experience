## Step 2: File-Specific Instructions

After setting up general project standards, you realize that your assignment files need more specific formatting rules. While your repository-wide instructions work great for general coding standards, you don't want to clutter them with detailed assignment structure requirements that get included in every chat message.

You want to make sure all your assignments follow the same pattern and structure so students have a consistent experience, but these rules should only apply when working on assignment files.

### üìñ Theory: Custom Instruction Files

Instruction files (`*.instructions.md`) provide targeted guidance for specific files or directories in your project.

Unlike repository-wide instructions that apply everywhere, `*.instructions.md` files use `applyTo` patterns in the [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to target specific files with [glob syntax](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/glob-patterns). This allows VS Code to automatically apply the instructions whenever Copilot works on files matching that pattern.

> You can also manually attach instructions using the **Add Context** button in Copilot Chat, however using `applyTo` patterns is much more convenient as they apply automatically when working on matching files.

Visual Studio Code by [default](vscode://settings/chat.instructionsFilesLocations) will look for `*.instructions.md` files in `.github/instructions/` directory.

> [!TIP]
> Instructions should focus on **HOW** a task should be done - describing the guidelines, standards, and conventions used in that particular part of the codebase

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create Assignment-Specific Instructions

Now let's create targeted instructions specifically for assignment files to ensure they follow consistent structure and formatting.

1. First, let's examine the existing assignment template. Open `templates/assignment-template.md` to see the structure we want all assignments to follow.

1. Create a new file called `.github/instructions/assignments.instructions.md`

1. Add the following content to define assignment formatting standards.:

   ```markdown
   ---
   applyTo: "assignments/**/*.md"
   ---

   # Assignment Markdown Structure Guidelines

   All assignment markdown files should follow these guidelines:

   ## 1. Template Usage

   - Assignment markdown files must follow the structure in [`templates/assignment-template.md`](../../templates/assignment-template.md).
   - The assignment must be created as a `README.md` file
   - Do not remove or skip required sections from the template.

   ## 2. Section Guidance

   The section headers should reflect the structure in the template, including the exact icon usage.

   - **Title**: Replace `[Assignment Title]` with a short, descriptive name (e.g., `Python Basics`, `Loops and Conditionals`, `Functions and Modules`).
   - **Objective**: Write 1-2 sentences summarizing what the student will learn or accomplish. Focus on the main skills or concepts.
   - **Tasks**: For each task:
      - Use a specific, action-oriented task name
      - In the Description, clearly state what the student must do.
      - In Requirements, use bullet points to list the expected outcomes or features. Be specific and measurable
      - Provide example input/output in code blocks if helpful.

   Do not include extra sections unless explicitly specified.
   ```

1. These instructions will be automatically applied with every chat request to Markdown (`.md`) files in `assignments` directory. Let's test it!

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Test the Assignment Instructions

1. Open the file `assignments/games-in-python/README.md` in VS Code. This assignment doesn't match all the conventions you've setup as a teacher.

1. Take a moment to review the current structure of this assignment file. Notice how it differs from the template structure you examined earlier. You can also view how it currently appears on the **Site Preview** tab.

1. With the assignment file open, ask Copilot Chat in `Agent` mode to update the assignment structure:

   ```text
   Update this assignment file to follow the project standards and template structure
   ```

1. Observe how Copilot references your instruction files in its response - you should see the `.github/instructions/assignments.instructions.md` file listed in the references section.

1. Compare the suggested changes with the original file structure to see how Copilot applied your instructions. Then apply the suggested changes and check how the updated assignment now appears on the **Site Preview**.

1. Commit both files with descriptive messages and push your changes to the `main` branch:

   - `.github/instructions/assignments.instructions.md`
   - `assignments/games-in-python/README.md`

1. Wait for Mona to prepare the next step!

<details>
<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

- Make sure you commited both files to `main` branch:
  - `.github/instructions/assignments.instructions.md`
  - `assignments/games-in-python/README.md`
